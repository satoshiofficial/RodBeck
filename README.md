# RodBeck Method

Code snippets, research materials, derivatives, notes, drafts, ideas and docs (the ones that were not acquired) from the Real-time Operative Data for Blockchain Entity-based Covid-19 Knowledgebases/Kmapping (RodBeck) Method, a proprietary cloud-based, multi-domain, multi-CNN evolutionary (generative) AI/ML solution for ER staff and frontline workers

Named in honor of Cryptologic Linguist MSG Antonio "Rod" Rodriguez (KIA 8 February 2020, Nangarhar Province, AF) and Casey Beckwith (9 September 1987 - 16 October 2015) RIP

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- A path on the plain - speech = one-dimensional, environment = two-dimensional
- Grammar = a slot existential before-fill mechanism – therefore, routing of activation of understanding can happen before completion
- Interaction Dynamics = Dialectics
- Grammar = data compression
- 1D serial nature of an audio stream
- Zero-th Differential Estimator In Feedback Loop – allows open-loop gradient decent training
- You need a loop. Not linearity. Not a linear process.
- Fundamental flaw in machine learning: not loop-based
- Each step is a loop. Shifting the path through the neural network.
- There is a fundamental reason why humans break words up into syllables.
- "into" "in-two" – 2 LOOPS
- First "in" activates a pathway ("in brain," in 'neural networks')
- "in" pathway lingers, while "to" activates new pathway
- Two pathways "co-mingle," creating a new understanding
