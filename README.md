Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- A path on the plain - speech = one-dimensional, environment = two-dimensional
- Grammar = a slot existential before-fill mechanism – therefore, routing of activation of understanding can happen before completion
- Interaction Dynamics = Dialectics
- Grammar = data compression
- 1D serial nature of an audio stream
- Zero-th Differential Estimator In Feedback Loop – allows open-loop gradient decent training
- You need a loop. Not linearity. Not a linear process.
- Fundamental flaw in machine learning: not loop-based
- Each step is a loop. Shifting the path through the neural network.
- There is a fundamental reason why humans break words up into syllables.
- "into" "in-two" – 2 LOOPS
- First "in" activates a pathway ("in brain," in 'neural networks')
- "in" pathway lingers, while "to" activates new pathway
- Two pathways "co-mingle," creating a new understanding
