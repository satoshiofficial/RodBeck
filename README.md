# RodBeck Method

Code snippets, research materials, derivatives, notes, drafts, ideas and docs (the ones that were not acquired) from the Real-time Operations Data for Blockchain Entity-based Covid-19 Knowledgebases/Kmapping (RodBeck) Method, a proprietary cloud-based, multi-domain, multi-CNN evolutionary (generative) AI/ML solution for ER staff and frontline workers

When pitched to investors in May 2020, it needed a name, so named it in honor of Cryptologic Linguist MSG Antonio "Rod" Rodriguez (KIA 8 February 2020, Nangarhar Province, AF) and Casey Beckwith (9 September 1987 - 16 October 2015) RIP

Evolutionary artificial intelligence and COVID-19

Using the Google Cloud AI platform, pioneered large-scale, evolutionary, rapidly-scaling, back-propagated artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, which helped determine where cases are, where the hot spots are and predicts where the next outbreak is going to happen.

Created after recovering from contracting Coronavirusdisease2019 in early February 2020, while working as a Sr. Azure Cloud Engineer for Microsoft, as a response tool for healthcare and frontline workers during the early stages of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.


Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- A path on the plain - speech = one-dimensional, environment = two-dimensional
- Grammar = a slot existential before-fill mechanism – therefore, routing of activation of understanding can happen before completion
- Interaction Dynamics = Dialectics
- Grammar = data compression
- 1D serial nature of an audio stream
- Zero-th Differential Estimator In Feedback Loop – allows open-loop gradient decent training
- You need a loop. Not linearity. Not a linear process.
- Fundamental flaw in machine learning: not loop-based
- Each step is a loop. Shifting the path through the neural network.
- There is a fundamental reason why humans break words up into syllables.
- "into" "in-two" – 2 LOOPS
- First "in" activates a pathway ("in brain," in 'neural networks')
- "in" pathway lingers, while "to" activates new pathway
- Two pathways "co-mingle," creating a new understanding
